This is the start page of plugin's documentation, and therefore likely the first thing people read.
This doc provides a brief overview of the functionality this plugin provides.

Write about why it is a good idea to use AsciiDoc and the plugin (and maybe when not to use it).
Mention unique-selling-propositions (USP) that differentiate this plugin from others.

Assumed reader type: someone who is new to the plugin, but might have heard about AsciiDoc before.
