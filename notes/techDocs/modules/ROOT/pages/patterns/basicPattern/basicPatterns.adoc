|Basic Patterns |Descriptions 

| Interface| Can be used to design a set of service provider classes that offer the same service so that a client object can use different classes of service provider objects in a seamless manner without having to alter the client implementation.
| Abstract Parent Class| Useful for designing a framework for the consistent implementation of the functionality common to a set of related classes.
| Private Methods| Provide a way of designing a class behavior so that external objects are not permitted to access the behavior that is meant only for the internal use.
| Accessor Methods| Provide a way of accessing an objectÂ’s state using specific methods. This approach discourages different client objects from directly accessing the attributes of an object, resulting in a more maintainable class structure.
| Constant Data Manager| Useful for designing an easy to maintain, centralized repository for the constant data in an application.
| Immutable Object| Used to ensure that the state of an object cannot be changed. May be used to ensure that the concurrent access to a data object by several client objects does not result in race conditions.
| Monitor| A way of designing an application object so that it does not produce unpredictable results when more than one thread tries to access the object at the same time in a multithreaded environment.
