==Scalability
**Scaling** is about allocating resources for an application and managing those resources
efficiently to minimize contention. The two primary approaches to scaling:
1. Vertical Scaling 
2. Horizontal scaling. 

Vertical scaling is the
simpler approach, though it is more limiting. Horizontal scaling is more complex, but
can offer scales that far exceed those that are possible with vertical scaling. Horizontal
scaling is the more cloud-native approach.
