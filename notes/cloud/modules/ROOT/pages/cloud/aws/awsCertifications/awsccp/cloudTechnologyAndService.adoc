== Task Statement 3.1: Define methods of deploying and operating in the AWS Cloud.

*Knowledge of:*
* Different ways of provisioning and operating in the AWS Cloud
* Different ways to access AWS services
* Types of cloud deployment models
* Connectivity options

*Skills in:*
* Deciding between options such as programmatic access (for example, APIs,
SDKs, CLI), the AWS Management Console, and infrastructure as code (IaC)
* Evaluating requirements to determine whether to use one-time operations
or repeatable processes
* Identifying different deployment models (for example, cloud, hybrid, onpremises)
* Identifying connectivity options (for example, AWS VPN, AWS Direct
Connect, public internet)

== Task Statement 3.2: Define the AWS global infrastructure.

*Knowledge of:*
* AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and edge locations
* High availability
* Use of multiple Regions
* Benefits of edge locations
* AWS Wavelength Zones and AWS Local Zones

*Skills in:*
* Describing relationships among Regions, Availability Zones, and edge
locations
* Describing how to achieve high availability by using multiple Availability
Zones
* Recognizing that Availability Zones do not share single points of failure
* Describing when to use multiple Regions (for example, disaster recovery,
business continuity, low latency for end users, data sovereignty)
* Describing at a high level the benefits of edge locations (for example,
Amazon CloudFront, AWS Global Accelerator)

== Task Statement 3.3: Identify AWS compute services.

*Knowledge of:*
* AWS compute services

*Skills in:*
* Recognizing the appropriate use of different EC2 instance types (for
example, compute optimized, storage optimized)
* Recognizing the appropriate use of different container options (for
example, Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS)
* Recognizing the appropriate use of different serverless compute options
(for example, AWS Fargate, Lambda)
* Recognizing that auto scaling provides elasticity
* Identifying the purposes of load balancers

== Task Statement 3.4: Identify AWS database services.

*Knowledge of:*
* AWS database services
* Database migration

*Skills in:*
* Deciding when to use EC2 hosted databases or AWS managed databases
* Identifying relational databases (for example, Amazon RDS, Amazon Aurora)
* Identifying NoSQL databases (for example, DynamoDB)
* Identifying memory-based databases
* Identifying database migration tools (for example AWS Database Migration
Service [AWS DMS], AWS Schema Conversion Tool [AWS SCT])

== Task Statement 3.5: Identify AWS network services.

*Knowledge of:*
* AWS network services

*Skills in:*
* Identifying the components of a VPC (for example, subnets, gateways)
* Understanding security in a VPC (for example, network ACLs, security groups)
* Understanding the purpose of Amazon Route 53
* Identifying edge services (for example, CloudFront, Global Accelerator)
* Identifying network connectivity options to AWS (for example AWS VPN,
Direct Connect)

== Task Statement 3.6: Identify AWS storage services.

*Knowledge of:*
* AWS storage services

*Skills in:*
* Identifying the uses for object storage
* Recognizing the differences in Amazon S3 storage classes
* Identifying block storage solutions (for example, Amazon Elastic Block Store [Amazon EBS], instance store) 
* Identifying file services (for example, Amazon Elastic File System [Amazon EFS], Amazon FSx) 
* Identifying cached file systems (for example, AWS Storage Gateway) 
* Understanding use cases for lifecycle policies
* Understanding use cases for AWS Backup

== Task Statement 3.7: Identify AWS artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)
services and analytics services.

*Knowledge of:*
* AWS AI/ML services
* AWS analytics services

*Skills in:*
* Understanding the different AI/ML services and the tasks that they accomplish (for example, Amazon SageMaker, Amazon Lex, Amazon Kendra)
* Identifying the services for data analytics (for example, Amazon Athena, Amazon Kinesis, AWS Glue, Amazon QuickSight)

== Task Statement 3.8: Identify services from other in-scope AWS service categories.

*Knowledge of:*
* Application integration services of Amazon EventBridge, Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS), and Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS)
* Business application services of Amazon Connect and Amazon Simple Email Service (Amazon SES)
* Customer engagement services of AWS Activate for Startups, AWS IQ, AWS Managed Services (AMS), and AWS Support
* Developer tool services and capabilities of AWS AppConfig, AWS Cloud9, AWS CloudShell, AWS CodeArtifact, AWS CodeBuild, AWS CodeCommit, AWS CodeDeploy, AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeStar, and AWS X-Ray
* End-user computing services of Amazon AppStream 2.0, Amazon WorkSpaces, and Amazon WorkSpaces Web
* Frontend web and mobile services of AWS Amplify and AWS AppSync
* IoT services of AWS IoT Core and AWS IoT Greengrass

*Skills in:*
* Choosing the appropriate service to deliver messages and to send alerts and notifications
* Choosing the appropriate service to meet business application needs
* Choosing the appropriate service for AWS customer support
* Choosing the appropriate option for business support assistance
* Identifying the tools to develop, deploy, and troubleshoot applications
