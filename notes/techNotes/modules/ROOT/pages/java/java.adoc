This is the start page of plugin's documentation, and therefore likely the first thing people read.
This doc provides a brief overview of the functionality this plugin provides.

Write about why it is a good idea to use AsciiDoc and the plugin (and maybe when not to use it).
Mention unique-selling-propositions (USP) that differentiate this plugin from others.

Assumed reader type: someone who is new to the plugin, but might have heard about AsciiDoc before.

The **Java Collections Framework** is a set of interfaces and classes in the packages
`java.util` and `java.util.concurrent`.

They provide client programs with various models of how to organize their objects, and various implementations of each model. These models are sometimes called **abstract data types**, and we need them because different programs need different ways of organizing their objects.

* `Iterable` defines the contract that a class has to fulfill for its instances to be usable with the `foreach` statement. It is not part of collection framework.

## Purpose Of Collections

1. `Collection` contains the core functionality required of any collection other than a `map`. It has no direct concrete implementations; the concrete collection classes all implement one of its sub-interfaces as well.

2. `Set` is a collection, **without duplicates**, in which **order is not significant**. `SortedSet` automatically sorts its elements and returns them in order. `NavigableSet` extends this, adding methods to find the closest matches to a target element.

3. `Queue` is a collection designed to accept elements at its _tail_ for processing, yielding them up at its _head_ in the order in which they are to be processed. Its subinterface `Deque` extends this by allowing elements to be added or removed at both head and tail. `Queue` and `Deque` have sub-interfaces, `BlockingQueue` and `BlockingDeque` respectively, that support concurrent access and allow threads to be blocked, indefinitely or for a maximum time, until the requested operation can be carried out.

4. `List` is a collection in which order is significant, accommodating duplicate elements.

5. `Map` is a collection which uses key-value associations to store and retrieve elements. It is extended by `ConcurrentMap`, which provides support for concurrent access, by `SortedMap`, which guarantees to return its values in ascending key order, by `Navigable-Map` which `extends SortedMap` to find the closest matches to a target element, and by `ConcurrentNavigableMap` which extends `ConcurrentMap` and `NavigableMap`.
