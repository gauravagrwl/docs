== Some topic need to refer
* https://github.com/google/auto/tree/main/value[AutoValue]: *AutoValue* is a source code generator for Java, and more specifically itâ€™s a library for generating source code for value objects or value-typed objects.

Value classes are extremely common in Java projects. These are classes for which you want to treat any two instances with suitably equal field values as interchangeable. That's right: we're talking about those classes where you wind up implementing equals, hashCode and toString in a bloated, repetitive, formulaic yet error-prone fashion.

AutoValue provides an easier way to create immutable value classes, with a lot less code and less room for error, while not restricting your freedom to code almost any aspect of your class exactly the way you want it.
